## 🎯 What it is

A real SaaS — not a tutorial project. Built end-to-end with the modern Next.js + Supabase stack, multi-tenant from day one, with the polish freelancers and agencies actually need:

- **Clients module** — full CRUD, status, notes, per-client invoice history
- **Invoices module** — auto-numbered `INV-####`, multi-line items, multi-currency, tax & discount, status pipeline (`draft → sent → paid → overdue`)
- **Branded PDF export** — server-rendered with your logo, business info, totals breakdown
- **Smart dashboard** — revenue trend (12 months), status mix, activity feed, date range filter (7d/30d/90d/12m), onboarding checklist
- **Multi-tenant auth** — Supabase Auth + Row-Level Security on every table. Users only ever see their own data
- **i18n** — English + Turkish, swappable via header toggle
- **Production touches** — toasts, skeleton loaders, empty states with illustrations, micro-interactions, gradient brand identity

## 🚀 Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goktugzaaa/invoicely.git
cd invoicely
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Set up your own Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
2. SQL Editor → run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql)
3. Auth → URL Configuration → add `http://localhost:3000/**`
4. Storage will auto-create the `logos` bucket via the schema
5. (Optional) edit [`supabase/seed.sql`](supabase/seed.sql) with your `auth.users.id` and run it for demo data

## 🗺 Roadmap
